  <p>3D model making technology is a professional basic course for film and television animation majors, art design majors, digital media majors, interior design majors, virtual reality and educational technology and other related majors.</p>
  <p>The course is aimed at students with zero foundation in 3D design, starting from the basic operation of 3ds Max, focusing on the project, and teaching the principle, operation technology, creative process and various modeling methods of 3D model making. The course is from shallow to deep, step by step, rigorous in theory and strong in practice. Introduce the core concepts of 3D modeling, the basic manipulation technology of software, the creation and modification of basic geometry, spline modeling technology, parametric deformation modification, polygon modeling technology, common modeling techniques and various modeling cases. and so on.</p>

  <h2>Lesson Plan</h2>
  <h3>1.Creating Geometry</h3>
  <p>The solid 3D objects in the scene, and the objects used to create them, are known as geometry. Usually, geometry comprises the subject of your scene and the objects that you render.</p>
  <h3>2.Surface Modeling</h3>
  <p>Surface modeling is more free-form than geometric (parametric) modeling.</p>

  <p>In parametric modeling, you create a primitive such as a sphere or a plane from the Create panel, and then use the existing settings (parameters) to change dimensions, segments, and so on. This method is powerful but extremely limited in scope.</p>

  <p>In surface modeling, you typically use the ribbon Convert to Poly command to convert an object to editable poly format. Alternatively, you can use the quad menu or modifier stack to “collapse” a parametric model to some form of editable surface: an editable poly, editable mesh, editable patch, or NURBS object. You can also use modifiers in some cases; this preserves access to the original parametric object. Once the object is in a surface-model format, 3ds Max gives you a variety of tools for shaping the surface. You perform much surface-modeling work by editing sub-objects of the surface object.</p>
  <h3>3.Rendering</h3>
<p>Rendering shades the scene's geometry using the lighting you've set up, the materials you've applied, and environment settings, such as background and atmosphere. You use the Render Setup dialog to render images and animations and save them to files . The rendered output appears in the Rendered Frame Window, where you can also render and do some setup.</p>
